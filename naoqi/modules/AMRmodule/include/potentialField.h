/*
  PotentialField class here implemented strongly refers to [1], it provides an algorithm for corridor navigation and obstacle avoidance using
  visual potentials. The robot is equipped with a camera system which captures frame from the environment.
  The optical ï¬‚ow and eventually the visual potential field are extracted from a sequence of images captured by the camera mounted on the
  robot. The algorithm makes the robot able to avoid obstacles without any apriori knowledge of the environment.

  Ones the dominant plane is extracted an artificial repulsive force from the obstacle area is generated using the gradient vector field.
  Simultaneously, the artificial attractive force is computed using both the gradient vector field and a constant feed forward that makes the robot
  move forward.
  As overall output the class is able to provide a velocity vector which is an average of the whole potential field. The velocity vector is splitted
  in its own x and y component that will be used as input for the controller (see Section 3 of the report).
